# 2.18
 
# Assume that we would like to expand the MIPS register file to 128 registers
# and expand the instruction set to contain four times as many instructions.

# 2.18.1

# How would this affect the size of each of the bit fields in the 
# R-type instructions?

# 2.18.2

# How would this affect the size of each of the bit fields in the 
# I-type instructions?

# 2.18.3

# How could each of the two proposed changes decrease the size of an 
# MIPS assembly program? On the other hand, how could the proposed change 
# increase the size of an MIPS assembly program?


# Answer


# 2.18.1

# opcode | rs | rt | rd | shamt | funct
# 	20  	7	7	 7  	3		20 Bits
