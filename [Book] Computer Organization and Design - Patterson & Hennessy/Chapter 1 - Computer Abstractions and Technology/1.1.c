 * Embedded Computers: They are single task computers that perform a single 
 * task with a large performance. In other words, they are low power consumption,
 * small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit-cost. For instance,
 * ATM machines, CD players, microprocessors, etc.

 * Personal Computers: They are the sophisticated version of smartphones. 
 * They are faster than smartphones, have higher computer power, and they 
 * are single user computers.
 
 * Super Computers: A super computer is a computer with high-level computational 
 * capacity compared to a general-purpose computer. Their memory are hundreds of 
 * terabytes and the performance of this computers are measured in foating-point 
 * operations per second (FLOPS). Because of their efficiency and performance,
 * they are very expensive.
