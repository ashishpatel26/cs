    "The Python interpreter can compute new values with function calls. You are familiar with the idea of functions from high school algebra. There you might define a function `f` by specifying how it transforms an input into an output, `f(x) = 3x + 2`. Then, you might write `f(5)` and expect to get the value 17.\n",
